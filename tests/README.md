Most of tests are generated by tests/testRunner.ts
In order to use testRunner you need to follow these naming conventions and file locations:

1. Locate the .yaml file under the 'tests/yamls' directory
2. Locate the "standart" for it under the 'tests/standarts' directory
3. Your .yaml file should be name \[filename here\].yaml
4. Your "standart" file should be name \[filename here\]\_standart.json

If you follow these conventions - the testRunner will be able to match the .yaml file to it's standart and perform test

Feel free to add some other files on which depends your .yaml scripts under the 'tests/yamls' - testRunner will ignore them unless then have .yaml extention

If you need some custom test logic, that could not be provided by test runner - you can write such tests separately and locate them under the 'tests/uncommon_tests'. Also locate there your standart and .yaml script. For the project style consistancy reasons, please follow the same naming convention for the files in 'tests/uncommon_tests' as you do in 'tests/yamls' and 'tests/standarts', though it is not compulsory from the technical perspective.
